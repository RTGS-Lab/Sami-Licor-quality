#Sami-Licor-quality

This repository contains quality-checked LI-COR sensor data collected from both corn and soybean fields as part of the Farm Management Decision Support project under RTGS-Lab.

## 📄 Overview

The goal of this project is to visualize and assess the quality of ET (Evapotranspiration) data from multiple LI-COR sensors deployed across research plots. These measurements are crucial for evaluating sensors quality.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `corn/` — Raw CSV files for corn node ET data (LI-COR 43 and 37A)
- `soybean/` — Raw CSV files for soybean node ET data (LI-COR 018 and 047)
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter Notebook for time series plotting and data validation

## 📊 Summary of Observations

### Corn (LI-COR 43 and 37A)
- Both sensors follow a generally consistent ET trend over time.
- Some data gaps and irregular values are present, likely due to sensor issues or logging interruptions.

### Soybean (LI-COR 018 and 047)
- Both sensors show similar ET trends.
- Data gaps and fluctuations may be caused by sensor performance or collection issues.
